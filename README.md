This is a C toolbox using some Public Domain tier code like `stb_image` (see [vendor](./vendor))
to manipulate images.

Only the very basics are implemented already.

# Disclaimer

This is just a starting project so it may be buggy.
It use C11 features, so it probably don't work with VisualStudio.
I don't know how far it is to work with windows.
I tried to stick with standard C but I may have put some POSIX or Linux only features.
I may remove them if possible.
